1.What is Devops?
Ans.
DevOps, a portmanteau of "development" and "operations," is a set of practices, methodologies, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration
and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, 
deliver software more frequently, and ensure a higher level of quality, reliability, and performance.

2.What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure ?
Ans.
Automation:
Automation refers to the process of using technology to perform tasks and processes without human intervention. It involves creating scripts, tools, or workflows 
that can execute repetitive tasks automatically. Automation helps reduce human error, increase efficiency, and streamline workflows. In the context of software development 
and operations (DevOps), automation is used to automate tasks such as code deployment, server provisioning, configuration management, testing, and monitoring.

Scaling:
Scaling involves adjusting the capacity of a system to handle changes in load or demand. In technology, scaling can refer to both vertical scaling (increasing the resources
of a single server or instance) and horizontal scaling (adding more servers or instances to distribute the load). The goal of scaling is to ensure that a system can accommodate 
increased user activity or data processing without compromising performance or reliability. Cloud computing platforms provide the infrastructure and tools to scale resources up or 
down based on demand.

Infrastructure:
Infrastructure refers to the underlying foundation of hardware, software, and networks required to support and operate applications, services, and systems. In the context of IT 
and technology, infrastructure includes servers, storage devices, networking equipment, data centers, and more. With the advent of cloud computing, infrastructure can be provided as 
a service (IaaS), allowing organizations to access and manage virtualized resources over the internet without owning and maintaining physical hardware.

3.Why DevOps is Important ?
Ans.
DevOps is important because it bridges the gap between software development and IT operations, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery through automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. 
This results in enhanced efficiency, reduced risk, and better user experiences.
